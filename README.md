DC Motors are electromechanical devices which use the interaction of magnetic fields and conductors to convert the electrical energy into rotary mechanical energy.

DC motors use magnetic fields that occur from the electrical currents generated, which powers the movement of a rotor fixed within the output shaft. 
The output torque and speed depends upon both the electrical input and the design of the motor.
